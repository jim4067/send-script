# SEND-SCRIPT

## Description

This is a spam program I wrote.

## Tech stack

This is a [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) project and I am using the following crates.

-   [autopilot](https://github.com/jim4067/autopilot-rs) The library I used to automate typing of the movie script.

## Source data üìù

I used a script I downloaded from The Internet Script Movie Database (IMSDb)

-   [IMSDb](https://imsdb.com/)

## What I learned?

-   I made my first open source contribution to a rust library.

## Going forward?

-   Make it possible to search and use a script online instead of having to download it locally.

## Project setup

clone this repo ` git clone`.

Build and run it using `cargo run` it.

Put the cursor on the message input box for the person you want to spam and let the games begin.
